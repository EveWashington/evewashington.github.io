# evewashington.github.io

This is the 2025 update of my portfolio site, its built mostly for fun and to push down the SEO results for my college site (which in case your curious now lives at https://evewashington.github.io/college-portfolio/). 

Also hopefully this can be a home some simple blog posts and more personal projects in the future.

# SvelteKit stuff 
This project is built with sveltekit. It uses google docs as a kinda micro-cms. Here's some basic svelte stuff: 

## Developing

After Cloning install dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server with:

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
